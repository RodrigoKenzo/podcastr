## Guide

If you want to reproduce this website on your own, you will have to use some commands and install some extensions.

First of all, to generate an next app, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js") installed. Then, execute this command on the bash.

```bash
    npm create-next-app "Name of the project"
```

Install Yarn, Typescript and Sass. Use the following commands on the terminal:

```terminal
    npm install --global yarn

    yarn add typescript @types/react @types/node -D

    yarn add sass

```

Tadaa! We have all things installed. Now it's up to you to look at the code and figure out what each command does. Have fun! =D
