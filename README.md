## Guide

If you want to work with this project, you will have to use some commands and install some extensions.

First of all, to generate a next app, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js") installed. Then, execute this command on Git Bash.

```bash
    npm create-next-app "Name of the project"
```

Install Yarn, Typescript and Sass. Use the following commands on the terminal:

```terminal
    npm install --global yarn

    yarn add typescript @types/react @types/node -D

    yarn add sass
```

Tadaa! We have everything setup. Now it's up to you to look at the code and figure out what each command does. Have fun! =D
